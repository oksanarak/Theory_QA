Test cases

A test case is a professional documentation of a tester, a sequence of actions aimed at testing some functionality, describing how to come to the actual result.

Test case attributes:
- A unique test case ID – is required for easy organization of storage and navigation through our test kits.
- The title – is the main theme or idea of ​​the test case. Brief description of its essence.
- Preconditions – a description of conditions that are not directly related to the tested functionality, but must be met. (For example, only a registered user can leave a comment on your portal. This means that for the “Creating a comment” test case, the precondition “user is registered” and “user is authorized” will be required).
- Steps – a description of the sequence of actions that should lead us to the expected result.
- Expected result – result what we expect to see after the steps are completed.

What else do you need to know before creating a test case?

First, each test case that is executed gives us one of three results:
	1. Positive result, if the actual result is equal to the expected result,
	2. Negative result, if the actual result is not equal to the expected result. In this case, an error is found.
	3. The test execution is blocked, if the test cannot be continued after one of the steps. In this case, the same error was found.

Secondly, one test case tests one specific thing, and for this thing there should be only one expected result.
 
What should not be in a test case:
 
1. Dependencies on other test cases.
2. Fuzzy wording of steps or expected result.
3. Lack of information necessary for passing the test case.
4. Too much detail.
